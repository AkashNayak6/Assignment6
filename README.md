# Assignment 6: Hash Tables, Data Compression, Tries

This assignment consists of analysis' and usage of Hashcode, separate chaining, linear probing, client problem, trie, TSTs, Huffman coding, compression algorithms and LZW compression.

Question 1: Hashcode, hash function, and hash table size

a. Separate Chaining, N = 10 i. Represent your answer as a two row table, the first row contains the index and the row contains a comma separated list of all values hashed to that index. The list should in order of first inserted to last inserted.

b. Linear Probing, N = 10 i. Represent your answer as a two row table, the first row contains the index and the second row contains the value hashed to that index.

Question 2: Client problem

Solve this problem using hashing without storing the actual values, no psuedocode required, and give example of solution

Question 3: Trie, TSTs

a. What is the height of the trie? Consider the root to be level ‘0’. 

b. Insert the values in-sequence into a TST. What is the height of the trie? 

c. What insertion order minimizes the height of the TST, and what is the height? 

d. What insertion order maximizes the height of the TST, and what is the height?

Question 4: Huffman coding

What happens if prefix free codes aren’t used in Huffman coding – is it a problem with encoding or decoding or both?

Question 5: Compression algorithms

Explain the sequences that generate the worst and best case compression ratios occur for the below compression algorithms: 

a. Run-length coding of N bits. 

b. Huffman Coding of N characters 

c. LZW of N characters

Question 6: LZW compression

Expand the dictionary and encode the below sequence using LZW compression: A B A A C D F A B A C D
